# React App for Front-End

## yarn start
    Starts the development server.

###  yarn build
- Bundles the app into static files for production.

###  yarn test

###  yarn eject
- Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

    yarn (or npm) start
